# thermometer
An animated thermometer indicator, with canvas.

For use the thermometer in your web pages, you only need to copy --> paste
the canvas and script objects into your html5 code.

Note that termome.js script need to be present in the js folder. 
But if you have your javascript files in a different location,
you only need to change it in the src attribute of the script object,
after you paste it in your web page.

If you change the size, keep relation 1x4 between width and height. But we recommend at least 50x200 px to see all details.

Demo page at: [Demo](https://jgirbau.github.io/thermometer/)

Is pretty easy, you can use it as a sample to create your own figures in canvas. 

(Note: the issue in the name of script is now fixed)

Good luck !
