# thermometer
An animated indicator in shape of a thermometer, with canvas.

For use the termometer in your web page, you only need to copy --> paste
the canvas and script objects to your html5 code.

note that thermo.js script need to be presentr in a js folder. 
But if you have your javascript files in a different location,
you only need to change it in the src attribute of the script object,
after you paste in your web page.

html code:
<canvas id="termome" width="100" height="400" data-valor="85" data-max="100"
style="background-color:#FFF">
</canvas>
<script src="js/termome.js"></script>

If you change the size, keep relation 1x4 between width and height. But we recommend at least 50x200 px to see all details.

Is pretty easy, you can use it as a sample to create your own figures in canvas. 

Good luck !
